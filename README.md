# CMSC447 Website Assignment

NOTE: This website *MUST* be hosted in order to be displayed correctly.
If you do not wish to host this website, some minor changes would have
to be made to how the CSS, JS, and pictures are organized within the
directory, and therefore the header code would change accordingly.

Please use a plugin, such as Visual Studio Code's 'Live Server' to easily
host this website and see it as it was intended to look.

I hope you enjoy my site!
